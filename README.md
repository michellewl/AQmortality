## Data classes

### London Air Quality Network (LAQN) data class
LAQN class for downloading &  processing of LAQN data. This code is adapted from my [COVID-19 repo](https://github.com/michellewl/COVID-19/blob/master/data/LAQN_class.py) (note that the borough averaging code has not been included here). See [here](https://github.com/michellewl/NO2-breast-cancer/tree/master/data/LAQN/download) for details on the source code (originally written for MRes project).

### Office for National Statistics (ONS) health data class
HealthData class for downloading & processing .xls(x) available on the ONS website.
